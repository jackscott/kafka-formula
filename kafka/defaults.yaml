  # :NOTE: nuanced zookeeper connection string scenarios ahead
  #
  # Because everyone's ZK setup is different and trying to accomidate everyone is hard,
  # we've decided to use a string or comma separated string of HOST:PORT combinations
  # with an optional CHROOT at the end.

  # zookeeper_conn examples:
  #   localhost:2181/kafka-brokers
  #   localhost:2181,otherhost:2181/kafka
  #   localhost:2181  
  #
  # 
  # a.) zookeeper_conn contains a chroot and zookeeper_chroot IS NOT SET
  #       use zookeeper_conn unmodified
  #
  # b.) zookeeper_conn contains a chroot and  zookeeper_chroot IS SET
  #       replace chroot in zookeeper_conn with whatever was defined in zookeeper_chroot
  #
  # c.) zookeeper_conn DOES NOT have a chroot and zookeeper_chroot is undefined/nil
  #       a hidden default of `/kafka` will be used for a chroot. Theres nothing worse than
  #       cluttering up / in zookeeper.
